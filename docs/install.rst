Building wasp-os from source
----------------------------

Building wasp-os and launching the wasp-os simulator requires Python 3.6
(or later) and the following python modules: click, numpy, pexpect, PIL
(or Pillow), pyserial, pysdl2.

On Debian Buster the required python modules can be obtained using the
following commands:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo apt install \
      wget git build-essential libsdl2-2.0.0 python3-click python3-numpy \
      python3-pexpect python3-pil python3-pip python3-serial unzip
    pip3 install --user cbor pysdl2

Additionally if you wish to regenerate the documentation you will require
a complete sphinx toolchain:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo apt install sphinx graphviz python3-recommonmark

Alternatively, if your operating system does not package some or any of
the above mentioned Python modules then you can install all of them
with pip instead:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip3 install --user -r wasp/requirements.txt

You will also need a toolchain for the Arm Cortex-M4. wasp-os is developed and
tested using the `GNU-RM toolchain
<https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm>`_
(9-2019-q4) from Arm.

.. note::

    There are known problems with toolchains older than gcc-7.3 when
    link time optimization is enabled during the MicroPython build
    (LTO is enabled by default).

Fetch the code from
`https://github.com/daniel-thompson/wasp-os <https://github.com/daniel-thompson/wasp-os>`_  and download the prerequisites:

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/daniel-thompson/wasp-os
    cd wasp-os
    make submodules
    make softdevice

To build the firmware select the command appropriate for your board from the
list below:

.. code-block:: sh

    make -j `nproc` BOARD=pinetime all
    make -j `nproc` BOARD=k9 all
    make -j `nproc` BOARD=p8 all

To rebuild the documentation:

.. code-block:: sh

    make docs

Device Support
--------------

Wasp-os can run on multiple devices and, in time, will hopefully be ported to
many more.

In terms of deciding which device to buy we can suggest two criteria to help.

The first is simply based on aesthetic appeal. A watch is something that you
take everywhere and sits somewhere between clothing and jewellery. That means
it is important to choose a device that feels good on the wrist and
looks right when you glance at it. Aesthetics matter!

The second criteria is more subtle. In most cases, there is not really many
important technical differences between the devices. They all use a Nordic
chipset and have the same display controller running a 240x240 panel. So the
second criteria is not technical, it is about community. The Pine64 PineTime is
unique among the devices supported by wasp-os because it is intended that the
watch be used to run a variety of different open source or free software
operating systems. By manufacturing a watch with the intention that it be
hacked every which way from Sunday then we get a bigger, stronger community
focused on the PineTime. There is a vibrant support forum, multiple different
OS developers (who share ideas and knowledge even when hacking on very different
code bases) combined with a `near complete set of hardware documentation
<https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PineTime>`_.

There's definitely a lot of fun to be had buying something off-the-shelf and
hacking it to become something the manufacturer never intended. We know this
because we've done it! However there is also enormous benefit from
participating in a community, especially if you enjoy working with or learning
from other developers. Devices that can repurposed to run wasp-os are often
only sold for short periods and may experience undocumented technical changes
between manufacturing runs that can cause compatibility problems. This makes it
hard for a large community to form around these devices.

Thus the second criteria it to think about your own needs and abilities. If
you want to enjoy the social and community aspects of working together on open
source watch development then you should look very closely at the PineTime.

Pine64 PineTime
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Pine64 PineTime <https://www.pine64.org/pinetime/>`_ is a square smart watch
based on an nRF52832 SoC and includes a 240x240 colour display with touch
screen, a step counter and a heart rate sensor.

wasp-os can be installed directly from the factory default operating
system using an over-the-air update with no tools or disassembly
required. nRF Connect for Android can be used to install both the
:ref:`wasp-bootloader<Bootloader nRF Connect>` and the
:ref:`main OS image<Main OS nRF Connect>`.

.. note::

    The early adopter PineTime Developer Edition came pre-programmed
    with a proprietary test firmware rather than the current factory
    default OS. If you have an early adopter unit then it will appear
    in the device list as *Y7S*. In this case the process needed for an
    OTA update is different. Use DaFlasher for Android to install both
    the :ref:`wasp-bootloader<Bootloader DaFlasher>` and the
    :ref:`main OS image<Main OS DaFlasher>`.

The `developer edition <https://store.pine64.org/?product=pinetime-dev-kit>`_
comes without the case glued shut. This allows access to the Serial Wire
Debug (SWD) pins which can make debugging easier. On developer edition
devices it is also possible to install the wasp-bootloader using an
:ref:`SWD programmer<Bootloader SWD>`.

The wasp-os simulator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simulator allows you to run wasp-os programs using the Python
interpreter included with your host operating system. The simulator
provides a 240x240 colour display together with a touch screen and a
physical button, all of which appears as a window on your host computer.

The simulator has large quantities of memory and, whilst useful for
exploring wasp-os and testing your programs are syntactically correct,
it is not a substitute for testing on real hardware. See
:ref:`Testing on the simulator` for more details on how to use the
simulator.

To launch the simulator try:

.. code-block:: sh

    make sim

Colmi P8
~~~~~~~~

The `Colmi P8 <https://www.colmi.com/products/p8-smartwatch>`_ is an almost
square smart watch based on an nRF52832 SoC and includes a 240x240 colour
display with touch screen, a step counter and a heart rate sensor.

.. warning::

    The P8 has multiple hardware revisions and the newest version (the
    one that includes a magnetic charger) uses a different and,
    currently, unsupported step counter module. The new models will
    boot wasp-os successfully but the step counter application will
    be disabled and cannot function.

DaFlasher for Android can be used to install both the
:ref:`wasp-bootloader<Bootloader DaFlasher>` and the
:ref:`main OS image<Main OS DaFlasher>`. No tools or disassembly is
required.

Senbono K9
~~~~~~~~~~

The Senbono K9 is a circular smart watch based on an nRF52832 SoC and includes
with a square 240x240 colour with a touch screen, a step counter and a heart
rate sensor.

The wasp-os port for Senbono K9 does not, at this point, include a driver for
the touch screen because the protocol has not yet been reverse engineered. The
touch screen enumerates via I2C at address 70d (0x46) and the interrupt can
be used to detect touch screen activity but the touch coordinates cannot be
read from the hardware. Currently the touch screen can only act as a
multi-function button and can be used to cycle through the quick ring and
display notifications. This makes the device usable but not fully featured.

Note also that the to conceal the square display within the circular face this
device has a heavily tinted filter over the display. This improves the look of
the device but also significantly dims the backlight making it difficult to
read the display in strong sunlight.

DaFlasher for Android can be used to install both the
:ref:`wasp-bootloader<Bootloader DaFlasher>` and the
:ref:`main OS image<Main OS DaFlasher>`. No tools or disassembly is required.

Installing wasp-bootloader
--------------------------

.. _Bootloader nRF Connect:

nRF Connect for Android
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For Pine64 PineTime devices running Infinitime then nRF Connect for Android
can be used to install wasp-bootloader:

* Ensure the watch is fully charged before attempting to install the
  wasp-bootloader. Running out of power during this process can brick
  sealed devices.
* Copy ``reloader-mcuboot.zip`` (see :ref:`Building wasp-os from source`) to
  your Android device and download
  `nRF Connect <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp>`_
  for Android if you do not already have it.
* Wake the device so that Infinitime is showing a watch face.
* Connect to the *Infinitime* device usnig nRF Connect, click the DFU button
  and send ``reloader-mcuboot.zip`` to the device.
* When the progress meter reaches 100% the nRF Connect will disconnect
  and the watch will reboot.
* The watch will boot the reloader application which draws a small blue
  pine cone in the centre of the screen. The pine cone acts a progress
  meter and will slowly become white. Once the update is complete the
  watch will show the wasp-os logo and an additional on-screen prompt.

`Over-the-air update from Infinitime to wasp-os <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPasAt1LJmo>`_

.. note::

    If you want to restore the PineTime factory firmware then you can
    use nRF Connect to do this. Perform a long press reset and then
    use nRF Connect to send ``reloader-factory.zip`` to the *PineDFU*
    device.

.. _Bootloader DaFlasher:

DaFlasher for Android
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the bootloader using DaFlasher for Android:

* Ensure the watch is fully charged before attempting to install the
  wasp-bootloader. Running out of power during this process can brick
  sealed devices.
* Download and install
  `DaFlasher <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atcnetz.paatc.patc>`_
  and copy the DaFlasher bootloaders to your Android device. You will need
  `DaFitBootloader23Hacked.bin <https://github.com/atc1441/DaFlasherFiles/blob/master/DaFitBootloader23Hacked.bin>`_ and
  `FitBootloaderDFU2.0.1.zip <https://github.com/atc1441/DaFlasherFiles/blob/master/FitBootloaderDFU2.0.1.zip>`_.
* Copy ``bootloader-daflasher.zip`` (see :ref:`Building wasp-os from source`
  above) to your Android device.
* Open the app and connect to the device (e.g. *Y7S* if you have a developer
  edition PineTime).
* Read the disclaimer carefully, then click **Ok**.
  PineTime).
* Click **Select file** and choose ``DaFitBootloader23Hacked.bin``, then wait
  for the payload to be transferred and for the install process to complete
  on the watch (leaving three coloured squares on the display).
* Press the Back button to return to the scanner and connect to the device.
  The device name will have changed to *ATCdfu*.
* Click **Do DFU Update**.
* Click **Select DFU file** and select ``FitBootloaderDFU2.0.1.zip``, then wait
  for the payload to transfer and the update to take place. The watch should
  be showing a single red square which is captioned *ATCnetz.de*.
* Click **Select DFU file** again and select
  ``bootloader-daflasher.zip``. Once the update is complete the watch will
  show the wasp-os logo and some additional on-screen prompt.

It is important to ensure that both ``bootloader-daflasher.zip``
and ``micropython.zip`` match the device you are installing for. There are
no runtime compatibility checks.

An end-to-end video of the above process (and the final install of wasp-
os) is also available:

`Installing MicroPython on a Colmi P8 smart watch using DaFlasher <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJoDtMy-4pk>`_

.. warning::

    The first step cannot be reversed. Once ``DaFitBootloader23Hacked.bin``
    has been installed the factory firmware will be permanently removed
    from the device.

    Although it is not possible to restore the factory firmware it is
    possible to switch back to Softdevice 5.0.1 and/or Softdevice 2.0.1
    on order to run alternative firmwares such as
    `ATCwatch <https://github.com/atc1441/ATCwatch>`_. The zip updates
    in `DaFlasherFiles <https://github.com/atc1441/DaFlasherFiles>`_ cannot
    be applied directly but we can return to the DaFlasher bootloaders
    by installing
    `DS-D6-adafruit-back-to-desay-sd132v201.zip <https://github.com/fanoush/ds-d6/blob/master/micropython/DS-D6-adafruit-back-to-desay-sd132v201.zip>`_
    followed by
    `ATCdfuFromSD2toSD5.zip <https://github.com/atc1441/DaFlasherFiles/blob/master/ATCdfuFromSD2toSD5.zip>`_

.. _Bootloader SWD:

Using an SWD programmer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are many different SWD programmers that can be used to install
wasp-bootloader. Use the
`PineTime SWD programming guide <https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/Reprogramming_the_PineTime>`_
to lookup the specific instructions for your programmer.

Use the SWD programmer to install ``bootloader.hex`` to the device.
This file is an Intel HEX file containing both the bootloader and the Nordic
SoftDevice. Once the bootloader is installed the watch will boot, display a
logo and wait for a OTA update.

.. note::

    If you have a new device then it may have been delivered with flash
    protection enabled. You must disable the flash protection before trying to
    program it.

    Be careful to disconnect cleanly from the debug software since just pulling
    out the SWD cable will mean the nRF52 will still believe it is being
    debugged (which harms battery life because the device won't properly enter
    deep sleep states).

Installing wasp-os
------------------

.. _Main OS nRF Connect:

nRF Connect for Android
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the main firmware using nRF Connect for Android:

* Copy ``micropython.zip`` (see :ref:`Building wasp-os from source`) to
  your Android device and download
  `nRF Connect <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp>`_
  for Android if you do not already have it.
* Connect to the device (e.g. *PineDFU* if you have a PineTime) using
  nRFConnect, click the DFU button and send ``micropython.zip`` to the device.
* When the upload is complete the watch will reboot and launch the digital
  clock application.

.. _Main OS DaFlasher:

DaFlasher for Android
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the main firmware using DaFlasher for Android:

* Copy ``micropython.zip`` (see :ref:`Building wasp-os from source`) to
  your Android device and download
  `DaFlasher <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atcnetz.paatc.patc>`_
  if you do not already have it.
* Open the app and connect to the device (e.g. *PineDFU* if you have a
  PineTime).
* Click **Do DFU Update**.
* Click **Select DFU file** and select ``micropython.zip``.
* When the upload is complete the watch will reboot and launch the digital
  clock application.

wasptool for GNU/Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the main firmware from a GNU/Linux workstation:

* Look up the MAC address for your watch (try: ``sudo hcitool lescan``\ ).
* Use ota-dfu to upload ``micropython.zip`` (see
  :ref:`Building wasp-os from source`) to the device. For example:
  ``tools/ota-dfu/dfu.py -z micropython.zip -a A0:B1:C2:D3:E3:F5 --legacy``

.. _Troubleshooting:

Troubleshooting
---------------

There are three boot modes of the device: OTA update mode, safe mode and normal
operation. Understanding these modes is useful to help troubleshoot
installation and boot problems.

OTA update mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bootloader mode is entered automatically of the boot image is invalid or if the
watchdog fires when running in another operating mode. OTA update mode can also
be can also be entered manually by holding a physical button on the device for
five seconds until the boot logo re-appears. When running in OTA update
mode pressing the physical button will attempt to launch the application.

.. note::

    To remain in OTA update mode it is import to release the button as
    soon as the boot logo appears otherwise you may acidentally request
    the bootloader restart the application!

When the bootloader starts it will display a boot logo for two seconds and will
then either boot the application or enter OTA update mode. OTA update mode
is easily recognised by the Bluetooth logo in the bottom right hand corner of
the display.

.. image:: res/Bootloader.png
   :alt: Bootloader splash screen overlaid on the simulator watch art
   :width: 179

When the device is in OTA update mode then it will enumerate with a name
ending in ``DFU`` (Device Firmware Update). This device can be used to
update the application image.

Safe mode
~~~~~~~~~

Safe mode is a special boot mode of the application that does not execute
``main.py`` automatically (and hence that the watch will not fully boot).
This ensures the Python REPL is accessible for debugging. Safe mode also
causes the watch to show it's boot activity on the screen which can be
useful for fixing hardware problems.

Safe mode is entered if the physical button is held down when the boot
logo disappears and the application first starts. The simplest way to
enter safe mode is to hold down the physical button until ``Init button``
appear on the screen, then release it.

A device running in safe mode will display the message ``Safe mode``
on the display. To exit safe mode return to OTA update mode by
holding down the physical button for five seconds and from there
a short press of the button will return the device to Normal operation.

Normal operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Underneath the covers normal operation is near identical to safe mode. There
are only two differences:

 * the boot messages will not appear unless a fault is detected (in which
   case ``FAILED`` will appear on the display)
 * it will execute whatever it finds in ``/flash/main.py``

A default version of ``main.py`` is installed automatically when wasp-os initially
formats the external flash as a file system.

Most problems with normal mode operation occur either because ``main.py`` is
missing, out-of-date or corrupt. These issues most commonly result in an
entirely black screen when running the watch is running in normal mode.

.. note::

   If the system reports FAILED at boot, in either safe mode or normal
   operation, then the best troubleshooting approach is to review
   the `issue tracker <https://github.com/daniel-thommpson/wasp-os/issues>`_.
   Initially look through the open issues and see if your problem is similar,
   if so there may be useful advice in the comments on the ticket. Otherwise
   if you cannot find anything similar then please raise a new issue.

main.py
~~~~~~~

By default main.py includes the following commands and, in normal operation,
these will be executed to boot the watch:

.. literalinclude:: main.py

One of the most powerful troubleshooting techniques (and one that is usually
effective in debugging "black screen" issues) is to switch to safe mode and
run the contents of ``main.py`` by hand using a bluetooth console (typically
either ``wasptool --console`` or an Android tool such as Serial Bluetooth
Terminal). Either the watch will start running when started by hand or it will
issue diagnostics via the console which can be captured and shared via the
`issue tracker <https://github.com/daniel-thommpson/wasp-os/issues>`_.

If the watch can be successfully started by hand then it is likely the copy
of ``main.py`` on your watch is broken, missing or out of date. You can explore
the watch's filesystem using the shell module:

.. code-block:: python

   from shell import *
   cd('/flash')
   ls
   cat('main.py')

If your copy of ``main.py`` needs to be updated you can use wasptool
to upload a new version:

.. code-block:: sh

   tools/wasptool --upload wasp/main.py

.. note::

   If you are not able to run wasptool on your system but have another means
   to access to the python REPL you can also use :py:meth:`shell.upload` to
   manually upload a new version of main.py.
