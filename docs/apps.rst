Watch faces
-----------

.. automodule:: apps.chrono

This application is very simple and largely serves as an example of how to
implement traditional watch faces.
It is not included by default in any image.
Instead it can be transferred to the device dynamically using wasptool:

.. code-block:: sh

    ./tools/wasptool --exec wasp/apps/chrono.py --eval 'wasp.system.register(ChronoApp())'

.. automodule:: apps.fibonacci_clock

This app is enabled by default in the simulator.
The app is also frozen into the firmware image but it is disabled by
default in order to keep RAM available for user developed applications.
It can be enabled by modifying ``main.py``.
