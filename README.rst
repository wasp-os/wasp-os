Watch Application System in Python
==================================

Introduction
------------

Wasp-os is a firmware for smart watches that are based on the nRF52
family of microcontrollers, including hacker friendly watches such
as the Pine64 PineTime. Wasp-os includes a digital clock, a stopwatch,
a step counter and a heart rate monitor. All of these, together with
access to the MicroPython REPL for interactive tweaking, development
and testing.

Wasp-os includes a robust bootloader based on the Adafruit NRF52
Bootloader. It has been extended to make it robust for development on
form-factor devices without a reset button, power switch, SWD debugger
or UART. This allows us to confidently develop on sealed devices relying
on Bluetooth Low Energy for over-the-air updates.

Documentation
-------------

Wasp-os is has `extensive documentation <https://wasp-os.readthedocs.io>`_
which includes a detailed `Application Writer's Guide
<https://wasp-os.readthedocs.io/en/latest/appguide.html>`_ to help you
get started coding for wasp-os as quickly as possible.

Getting Started
---------------

Wasp-os can be installed without using any tools or disassembly onto the
following devices:

 * Pine64 PineTime
 * Colmi P8
 * Senbono K9

Use the
`Installation Guide <https://wasp-os.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_
to learn how to build and install wasp-os on these devices.

At the end of the install process your watch will show the time (03:00)
together with a date and a battery meter. When the watch goes into power
saving mode you can use the button to wake it again.

At this point you will also be able to use the Nordic UART Service to
access the MicroPython REPL. You can use ``tools/wasptool --console``
to access the MicroPython REPL.

To set the time and restart the main application:

.. code-block:: python

   ^C
   watch.rtc.set_localtime((yyyy, mm, dd, HH, MM, SS))
   wasp.system.run()

Or, if you have a suitable GNU/Linux workstation, just use:

.. code-block:: sh

   ./tools/wasptool --rtc

which can run these commands automatically.

As mentioned above there are many drivers and features still to be
developed, see the :ref:`Roadmap` for current status.

wasp-os also contains a library of additional applications for you to choose.
These are disabled by default but can be easily enabled by adding them
using one of the techniques is the Application Writer's guide.
